## Instructions for Claude Code

You are about to build **MemoryMosaic Premium**. This document orchestrates the entire build process.

### How it works:

1. **Read this file completely**
2. **Work through phase by phase** (from Phase 1 to the end)
3. **Per phase:** Open the specified MD file under `docs/`
4. **Execute ALL tasks in the MD file**
5. **Mark tasks as done** (checkboxes in the MD file)
6. **Checkpoint:** Verify everything works at the end of each phase
7. **Only when phase is complete:** Move to the next phase
8. **On errors:** Stop, fix, then continue

## Important Rules

### DO:
- ✅ Process tasks in the specified order
- ✅ Create code exactly as described in the MD files
- ✅ When unclear: Ask instead of guessing
- ✅ Regularly check `npm run dev`
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors immediately

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip phases
- ❌ Skip tasks
- ❌ Add your own "improvements"
- ❌ Change dependencies without reason
- ❌ Continue on errors

---

## Checkpoint Questions (after each phase)

Answer these questions before moving to the next phase:

1. **Are all tasks in the phase checked off?**
2. **Does `npm run dev` run without errors?**
3. **Are there TypeScript errors?** (if yes: fix them)
4. **Does the feature work as expected?**

Only when all answers are positive → Move to the next phase.

---

## Start Build

**IMPORTANT:** Start with Phase 0 (Research) BEFORE writing any code!

**Now:** Open `docs/00-research.md` and begin with Phase 0!

This research phase uses WebSearch to gather:
- Real competitor data and pricing
- Market size and trends
- User pain points from reviews

The research results inform:
- Your pricing strategy
- Landing page copy (differentiation from competitors)
- Feature prioritization

```
# After research, start the app:
npm run dev
```

Am Ende sollte die komplette App laufen mit:
- ✅ Research (competitor analysis, pricing benchmark)
- ✅ Auth (Login, Signup, Logout)
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Entity CRUD
- ✅ Landing Page (informed by research!)
- ✅ SEO

**Los geht's mit der Research Phase!**
